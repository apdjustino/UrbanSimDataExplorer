            <h5>What is a land use forecast?</h5>
            <p class="faq-answer">
                Metropolitan planning organizations and long-range planning organizations forecast land use to inform regional planning and transportation policy. The DRCOG land use forecast consists of a projection of households, employment, and population out to 2040. DRCOG implements a version of UrbanSim, a regional land use forecasting model, to forecast household, population, and employment growth throughout the DRCOG region.

            <h5>What is a zone?</h5>
            <p class="faq-answer">
                A zone is an area of analysis defined by the models used by DRCOG. The boundaries are available in
                DRCOG's Regional Data Catalog. Download
                <a href="http://gis.drcog.org/datacatalog/content/traffic-analysis-zone-boundaries" class="help-link">here</a>.

            <h5>What is an urban center?</h5>
            <p class="faq-answer">
                The urban centers element of Metro Vision reflects a desire for the Denver region to become and international model for healthy, livable communities. Vibrant urban centers connected by a robust multi-modal network are central to this vision. Each urban center is unique, but all will: 1) be active, pedestrian-, bicycle-, transit-friendly places that are more dense and mixed in use than surrounding areas; 2) allow people of all ages, incomes, and abilities to access a range of housing, employment, and service opportunities without sole reliance on having to drive; 3) promote regional sustainability by reducing per capita vehicle miles traveled, air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption; 4) respect and support existing neighborhoods.

                <h5>What is a Zone ID / TAZ ID?</h5>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Zone ID and TAZ IDs are unique identifiers for a TAZ. Both are used by DRCOG models, and different
                    jurisdictions use different identifiers. You can download the TAZ shapefile at the
                    <a href="http://gis.drcog.org/datacatalog/content/traffic-analysis-zone-boundaries" class="help-link">Regional Data Catalog</a>
                     where you can find a crosswalk between the two IDs.

                <h5>Why did links to add comments disappear?</h5>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Comments can be made on only one geography at a time. The comment link disappears when you have more than one
                    geography selected, or if you do not have any geographies selected. To comment on a geography, make sure
                    that you have only selected one geography. Also, comments are specific to the selected year, so be sure to keep
                    track of which year is selected before you make a comment.
